## First Step (Cloning GitHub repositori)

Navigate to [Camaleonic App Code](https://github.com/FranBF/camaleonic-fran-test.git) and clone the repository in your development folder.

Once you have cloned the repository, open the project in your trusted IDE.

`npm install` > this to install dependencies
`npm run dev` > this to serve the project locally
